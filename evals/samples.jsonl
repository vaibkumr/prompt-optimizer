With a cigar in his mouth, and his hands behind his back, he was strolling about his handsomely furnished sitting-room at Claridge's, dictating to a secretary, while from an adjoining room came the faint click of a typewriter. Virginia entered somewhat unceremoniously, followed by Guy. Phineas Duge looked at them both in some surprise. \n\n\"Uncle,\" she said, \"I met Guy coming away from Coniston Mansions. He was looking for me, and I have brought him to see you.\" \n\nPhineas Duge held out his hand, and in obedience to a gesture, the secretary got up and left the room. \n\n\"I am very glad to meet you, sir,\" he said. \"By the by, my niece has only mentioned your first name.\" \n\n\"I am the Duke of Mowbray,\" Guy said simply, \"and I am very glad indeed to meet you if you are Virginia's uncle. I think that she treated me rather badly a week ago, but I am disposed,\" he added, with a twinkle in his eyes, \"to be forgiving. I want your niece to be my wife, sir.\" \n\n\"Indeed!\" Mr. Duge answered a little drily. \"I can't say that I am glad to hear it, as I have only just discovered her myself.\" \n\n\"There is no reason, sir,\" Guy answered, \"why you should lose her.\" \n\n\"You don't even know my uncle's name yet,\" Virginia said, smiling. \n\n\"I am Phineas Duge,\" Duge answered. \"I dare say you have never heard of me.

Lin took her role as the \"big sister\" seriously. When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. \"I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself,\" she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. \"Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways. They give kids something that parents don't.\" Laura Walker, a professor from Beijing University, told China Daily. She noted that having a brother or a sister protects teenagers against loneliness, fear and so on. Liu Fang, 20, from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister. When her sister disagreed with parents over choosing a college major, she helped her to communicate with parents. \"If necessary, I would always have her back,\" said Liu. \"The best part of having a sister is that you have a partner, friend and supporter throughout your life.\" But children with brothers or sisters also have to learn to understand and look after each other, said Laura."},{"role":"system","content":"Q: According to the new policy, how many children are now allowed?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: two || A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children.","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: When was it enacted?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: October 29 || A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children.","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: How far back was the original policy?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: about 40 years ago ||  the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago.","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: How many children were allowed then?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: one || Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago.","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: How old is Lin Xiao?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: 21 || Lin Xiao, 21","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: What does she do?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: She's a student. || Lin Xiao, 21, a student at Guangdong University,","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: Where?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: at Guangdong University || Lin Xiao, 21, a student at Guangdong University,","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: Does she have a large family?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: yes || Lin Xiao, 21, a student at Guangdong University, has a big family","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"user","content":"Q: Who does it consist of?"}],"ideal":"(Disregard Including Quote) Anything along these lines is correct: \nher parents, a brother and two sisters\nHer two parents, a younger brother and two younger sister\nher two parents, a younger brother and two younger sisters\ntwo parents, a younger brother and two younger sisters"}

The process and ceremonies of ordination vary by religion and denomination. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The liturgy used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordination. \n\nThe tradition of the ordained monastic community (\"sangha\") began with the Buddha, who established orders of monks and later of nuns. The procedure of ordination in Buddhism is laid down in the Vinaya and Patimokkha or Pratimoksha scriptures. There exist three intact ordination lineages nowadays in which one can receive an ordination according to the Buddha's teachings: \n\nSaicho repeatedly requested that the Japanese government allow the construction of a Mahayana ordination platform. Permission was granted in 822 CE, seven days after Saicho died. The platform was finished in 827 CE at Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei, and was the first in Japan. Prior to this, those wishing to become monks\/nuns were ordained using the Hinayana precepts, whereas after the Mahayana ordination platform, people were ordained with the Bodhisattva precepts as listed in the Brahma Net Sutra."},{"role":"system","content":"Q: What is the article about?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: Ordination || Ordination","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: What is the meaning of it?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: process by which individuals are consecrated || Ordination is the process by which individuals are consecrated","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: Who did it begin with?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: Buddha || The tradition of the ordained monastic community (\"sangha\") began with the Buddha","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: What else is Buddha responsible for?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: established orders of monks || Buddha, who established orders of monks","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"user","content":"Q: Where can you find the procedure outlinw?"}],"ideal":"(Disregard Including Quote) Anything along these lines is correct: \nPratimoksha scriptures\nin the Vinaya and Patimokkha or Pratimoksha scriptures\nin the Vinaya and Patimokkha or Pratimoksha scriptures\nBrahma Net Sutra"}

Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her. \n\nEven Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him. \n\nStill retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester. \n\n\"You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester,\" he said. \"One of your conditions I have obeyed. With regard to the other, I have done as I thought fit. However, to-day she is her own mistress. She has consented to be my wife. I do not need to ask for your consent or approval.
